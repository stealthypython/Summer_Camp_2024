# Python Projects! 🚀

Hi there! I'm Anzie Ghimire, a 9-year-old Python programmer.  I built these cool projects at summer camp in 2024!

## Check out my creations:

* **Grocery List Program:**  Never forget a thing at the store! My program helps you build a shopping list, sort it, and even remove items you decide you don't need. 🛒
* **tirtle:** Wonderful art using turtle
* **Guess the word:** Curious word guessing game
* **[And so on...]**

## Why I love Python:

Python is like building with LEGOs, but instead of making spaceships, you make awesome programs!  I'm learning to:

* **Solve problems:** Python helps me figure things out, like how to make a list or do math.
* **Be creative:** I can build games, tools, or anything I can imagine!
* **Have fun!** Programming is like a puzzle, and I love figuring out the pieces.

## I'm just getting started!

I'm excited to keep learning and building even cooler things with Python. ✨

**Happy coding!** 🐍
